Dataset acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks?select=data.csv

Looking to build a classifier to determine what contributes to why a song is deemed "popular" throughout the decades, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s and now in 2020. Popularity was a variable ranging from 0-100. "The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular.
The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.
Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past." - https://community.spotify.com/t5/Content-Questions/Artist-popularity/td-p/4415259
